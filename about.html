  <p>My name is Ugur Koysuren. I am a Software Developer from Nuremberg, Germany. I’m trilingual, I’m fluent in Turkish, German and English.

I started out programming when I was about 13, I was designing basic HTML websites. Since I didn’t had a valid credit-card I was only able to use free hostings and websites. Then I found out that a local hosting provider accepts payments also from the local post offices. I started my first VPS, launched several vBulletin forums, registered new domains and started broking domains at the age of 15.

My passion is software but I also have knowledge about the hardware stuff so I can go all the way down to the metal when necessary.

I took Science and Math classes all through high school, then took the passion to college as well. I received a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the Ozyegin University in 2017.
When I’m not working, I’m usually hanging out with my friends, programming for fun, or playing video games</p>
